## Tech Stack

| Technology | Usage |
|---|---|
| Java | Core application logic |
| JavaFX | UI design and front-end development |
| SQLite | Local database for persistent storage |
| JWT | Secure authentication and authorization |
| Git & GitHub | Version control and collaboration |

## Project Scope
- Focused on volunteer–organization engagement
- No payment integration
- No mobile application
- No advanced AI-based matching
- Designed as a standalone desktop application

## My Role
- **UI/UX Designer & Team Manager**
- Designed application interfaces and layouts using pure JavaFX
- Contributed to front-end development and visual consistency
- Coordinated team workflow and design direction
- Helped overcome technical limitations of JavaFX through iterative design

## Problem Statement
In Pakistan, volunteering opportunities are often scattered across informal networks, making it difficult for citizens—especially youth—to find verified and suitable opportunities.  
Philox addresses this gap by providing a centralized, credible, and structured platform that strengthens civic engagement and promotes national social development.
